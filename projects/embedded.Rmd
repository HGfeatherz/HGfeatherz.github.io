## Introduction

During my PhD, I started looking at embedded software development (think writing code to a chip on a board, with a specific purpose in mind like measuring temperature). This was the height of Covid restrictions and I needed to optimise measurements.
To this end, I ended up building a sensor array for measuring Total Volatics and CO2.
