## Work Experience

### AngloAmerican 2022-Current

2.5 years as a data scientist working with the agricultural sector in Sales and Marketing
Using *R*, *Python* and *SQL*, i've been generating insights and building value in a variety of project work across the buisness unit.

Projects i've worked on have included modeling weather data to determine drought status, and measuring the impact of our product (POLY4) in relation to those conditions.

I've also worked on various insight generation projects, wherein a specific question has required me to build unique scripting for dashboard services such as PowerBI, where the value of the data could be enchanced through unique visuals and statstical power.

### PhD Student: 2017-2022

A research project investigation the potential for biological amendments (read: *rhizobacteria* and *mychorriza*) to enhance the efficacy of peat-free growing media in potted herbs.

This project involved a series of self-designed trials testing various amendments, substrates, fertilizers and products in order to optimize the growth potential of Basil and Corriander.

During the development of this research, I (like most of the world) ended up being effected by the Covid-19 pandemic, effectivly restricting access to sites and facilities.

A solution to this was to develop sensor arrays that would deliver real-time data without the need to be present in the facilities. It was during the course of development for these sensors that I found a profound interest in programming langauges.

# Projects

**Project 1**

*Peat-Free vs Peat; biological amendments* [R]

This is a quick look at some of my PhD data, I wanted to remind myself of how it looked, and to pull out some broad themes from the results.

**Project 2**

*PDF scanner* [Python]

I needed to find some documents with keywords in them, this is a scanner for pdf files.

**Project 3**

*KNN* [R]

A foray into ML models, looking at the iris dataset for categorising plant species using K-clustering
